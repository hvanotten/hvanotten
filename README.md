### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building things in React. I am a passionate problem solver with experience in JavaScript, Node, React, and Redux. I enjoy using my passion for helping others, attention to detail to help make things that make a difference. When I'm not coding I love to cook, read, play music or video games.
